5 because i know that i would prefer the saucier veggie filled version that i have been making for years lt br gt lt br gt this casserole is very similar to one that my family has been making for well over 20 years my sister found the original recipe for a quot chicken num num quot casserole in a magazine or from one of those subscription recipe collections the chicken num num recipe she found uses 1 can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups but no milk or broth to thin out the condensed soups the 1 2 cup mayo as well as 2 cans of french cut green beens well drained all of the shredded cheese is blended into the creamy chicken amp green been fillng amp the biscuits are topped with finely crushed crakers the chicken num num recipe called for putting the biscuits onto the filling right away topping them with crushed crackers and putting the completely assembled casserole into the oven for a longer cook time in order to get the filling hot enough to cook the bottoms of the biscuits we forgot the crackers once amp discovered that the cracker crumb biscuit topping served the important purpose of keeping the tops from over cooking by the time the filling had gotten hot enough to fully cook the bottoms of the bisquits that 039 s certainly the easiest cooking method provided that you don 039 t forget or omit the cracker crumb topping to protect the tops of the

       "   'review': 'the first time i made this recipe i thought it was a 4 star recipe you know pretty good but no cartwheels since i can t follow a recipe i used cake flour instead of all purpose reduced fat margarine instead of shortening mashed banana instead of applesauce yogurt instead of milk 1 2 cup chocolate chips instead of 1 4 cup raisins and whole graham crackers instead of crumbs why make crumbs when the point is to make a bottom layer for the cake that time it was a bit overdone for 6 minutes at half power 4 minutes full power in my 1250 watt microwave then it was a hot hot summer day i wanted chocolate cake and i didn t want to get the kitchen hotter since it turned out ok despite substitutions the first time i thought i d try it again this time i used cake flour instead of all purpose flour again 1 4 cup reduced fat margarine instead of 1 3 cup shortening mashed banana instead of applesauce again no eggs i just plain forgot 4 tbs chocolate soy milk instead of 3 tbs milk i skipped raisins i added 1 3 cup cocoa powder and i lined the bottom with whole graham crackers instead of graham cracker crumbs again i microwaved it for 5 minutes at full power and 2 5 minutes at half power instead of half power first for the longer time then a shorter time at full power oops that s not too close to the original recipe the verdict is that i need more sugar when i add cocoa powder and i prefer the texture variation from adding chocolate chips or raisins or shredded coconut but it works i can t really taste the banana but that s fine it s in here because i had a black banana that needed to be used and toddler and i wanted chocolate cake i ve very sensitive to baking powder it all tastes metallic even bakewell cream tastes funny unless i make my own on the spot and now my baby has allergies to milk egg and soy so i ve had to vary it up again on the third try i used coconut oil instead of shortening to avoid milk and soy i used 1 banana instead of applesauce to use up a black banana the toddler didn t eat skipped the eggs and 5 tbs rice milk to make up for the moisture from the eggs i added 1 3 cup special dark cocoa and sprinkled 1 4 cup chocolate chips on top for the texture i enjoy since it s cooler now and i was baking already i baked it for 30 minutes at 350 f again it was fine i ve made it in a 9x9 pan an 8 round pan and a 10x4 loaf pan all with good results the reasons why i give it 5 stars instead of 4 stars i keep making this recipe i m really impressed that i ve made so many changes never once have i followed the original recipe and it still turned out as a decent cake i ve had better chocolate cake before but not as quickly plus once i added icing it seemed a lot closer to any other cake it doesn t use baking powder it s really fast to come out of the microwave so let s see it s fast it s nearly bulletproof i make it often and it tastes fine ok that s a 5 star recipe',\n",

       "   'review': 'hi all this will be long because i really really hope to figure out what i did wrong i hope there 039 s some smart person out there who will read all this and comment i do want to learn and correct i cooked the pork chops yum yum last night i have never ruined pork this badly before i read almost a hundred of the reviews decided to do stove top like most i bought two boneless pork loin chops about little less than 3 4 inches thick but did not brine them maybe i should have i trimmed a little of the fat and added a little pepper and sauteed off the chops in about a tablespoon of olive oil only 2 min on each side for fear of overcooking them ha boy was i wrong i minced a clove of fresh garlic and a good teaspoon of fresh ginger and per one reviewer made pole to pole cuts of half a large yellow onion once the meat was sauteed i put the chops on a warm plate for a minute while i sauteed the garlic ginger and onions for about two minutes to sweat them a little and until the garlic started to smell good i did this on a med low flame then i added the tripled sauce ingredients as per many reviewers so used for triple sauce 3 4 cup chicken broth 3 8 cup honey 3 8 cup regular soy sauce and 3 tablespoons ketchup all went into the saute pan with the onion garlic mix also per one reviewer the one who suggested the onions i added 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar because that is a normal ingredient in most asian sauces i put the chops back into the saute pan brought the sauce up to a simmer and then turned the heat down low so i only had it quot burbeling quot if that is a word and covered the pan per another reviewer i turned the chops every 5 minutes for a total of 20 minutes i pulled the chops off to a warm plate and added 1 tablespoon cornstarch already mixed with 1 tablespoon water and the sauce really needed the thickener i brought the heat up and stirred for about 4 minutes at medium heat till the sauce thickened nicely served the chops over rice and broccoli on the side now when i tell you that i am a pretty good cook really i am i have never had to work so hard at cutting a good piece of meat the chops were so tough that my life partner shoved them away in disgust i ate mine out of shame but it was really hard to cut okay smart people what did i do wrong or where did i go wrong was it the vinegar that toughened the meat was the 20 minutes already a much shortened cooking time too long the meat quality was the best i could buy from the vons which is safeway out here good meat department i didn 039 t skimp on the quality the sauce was okay nothing special or different than what i would get at a local chinese restaurant but certainly not what most of the reviewers mentioned just sort of middle of the road okay chinese sauce so i am genuinely interested in what i must have done or why the pork toughened up that badly never in my life have i had such a tough piece of meat couldn 039 t even get the steak knife through it had to saw and saw so i want to learn here and would be very grateful if someone or more than one person would comment on what i should have done or where i went wrong i do appreciate the time and thank you all for your thoughts lt br gt citrus1000',\n",

over 20 years my sister found the original recipe for a quot chicken num num quot casserole in a magazine or from one of those subscription recipe collections the chicken num num recipe she found uses 1 can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups but no milk or broth to thin out the condensed soups the 1 2 cup mayo as well as 2 cans of french cut green beens well drained all of the shredded cheese is blended into the creamy chicken amp green been fillng amp the biscuits are topped with finely crushed crakers the chicken num num recipe called for putting the biscuits onto the filling right away topping them with crushed crackers and putting the completely assembled casserole into the oven for a longer cook time in order to get the filling hot enough to cook the bottoms of the biscuits we forgot the crackers once amp discovered that the cracker crumb biscuit topping served the important purpose of keeping the tops from over cooking by the time the filling had gotten hot enough to fully cook the bottoms of the bisquits that 039 s certainly the easiest cooking method provided that you don 039 t forget or omit the cracker crumb topping to protect the tops of the

    "check_str = 'first off i have to admit that i have written this review a couple times already and admittedly i was so angry i couldnt write it properly  so after trying to settle down a bit here goesltbrgtltbrgta  the recipe is very poorly written  i have provided many recipes over the years to family friends and as contributions to charityfundraiser cookbooks  i write recipes in painstaking detailnothing unnecessaryso that the cook who is using my recipe doesnt have to guess about what they need to do  everything must be spelled out preciselyltbrgtltbrgtb  when i am following a recipe i prepare all the ingredients as listed and described completely so when its time to use them im not scurrying around for somethingltbrgt\\ti  direction number two is quotfry the onion till golden in a couple of tablespoons of lightly browned butter  the recipe calls for  tbsp of butter  direction number  is quotfry them slowly in plenty of butterquot  what is plenty of butter  this needs to be more specific  when cooks have prepared something many times they progress beyond needing specific amounts often because they have personalized the recipe and its their own  but this and every published recipe must be done as though the chef is making the recipe for the first time  because this was my first  time as i said i followed the directions exactlyltbrgt\\tii  based on the list of ingredients i made sure i had soy sauce on hand  admittedly the recipe called for  teaspoon of soy sauce  really  in a pound of meat  teaspoon of soy sauce but wait  after making sure you have the soy sauce it is never mentioned again  where are we to put the soy sauce  in the meat  in the cream sauceltbrgt\\tiii  the ingredients call for quot cup cream half and half or  cup milk  im sorry but this is unintelligible  should we use cream or half and half or milk  why is quothalf and halfquot in brackets  cream is cream  half and half is half and half and milk is milk  decide and then tell us what to do  if we want to change it to accommodate a particular lifestyle we will change it but please be clear about what the cook is supposed to useie tell us what the standard of quotexcellencequot is for this recipe  what in your mind makes it bestltbrgtltbrgtc  after assembling the called for ingredients and absolutely omitting the water because by the time all the other ingredients were assembled it was raw soup not able to be formed into meatballs i could not begin to move forward with shaping them into ballsltbrgtltbrgtd  i suggest the following which i did in an effort to save the  i spent on meat and ingredients i didnt have on hand  again if you want to make changes to make it your own ok but i can only tell you what worked for meltbrgt\\ti  use cream not  half and half and not milk  use  cupltbrgt\\tii completely omit the waterltbrgt\\tiiibased on this recipe use at least c dried breadcrumbs and more if necessaryltbrgt        iv add some flavor to the meat  there is nothing but allspice and that according to the ltbrgtquotsourcequot is optional  i dont know about you but i think meatballs are basically miniround meatloaves  i do not make a meatloaf devoid of seasoning  why would i make a meatball devoid of seasoning  yes i know that people rave about the sauce but i have learned this in my years of cooking  if the meat itself is not seasoned and only depends on the sauce its in for flavor what you get is a mouthful of unflavored meat with some sauce on it  i learned this the hard way with quotthe best chili you will ever tastequot when i thought the chili was magnificent until i tasted the meat and it was like having a mouthful of flavorlesssomething  meat needs to be able to stand on its own and then be enhanced by a saucethe sauce cannot make up for flavorless meat  i dont know what ikea meatballs are likeperhaps they are supposed to be bland and let the sauce do the workpersonally i added  two teaspoons of cumin two teaspoons of ground coriander two teaspoons of ground fennel and cloves of garlic to go along with the onionltbrgt\\tv  chill the meatball mixture for  hours  more is ok less is not a good idealtbrgt\\tvi  dont just cook the meatballs slowly in plenty of butter  use two tablespoons of butter clarified if possible and two tablespoons of olive oil  because you are cooking slowly so as to make sure the meatball is cooked through without the outside being ruined you can use olive oil despite it relatively low smoking point  it will be okbut cook on medium heat at best  im not being specific here because there are so many permutations of rangesi use a viking stovetop and have complete controlso anything wrong is my faultto lower and raise temp immediately  ltbrgtltbrgti have now based on the original recipe and
