I did use an oil spritzer and browned the breaded (used Panko) eggplant on a griddle. Added my &quot;bruschetta&quot; (tomatoes, basil &amp; red pepper flakes) home canned sauce, and a little garlic powder, cheese . layered in a 9 x 13 oven baking dish. Even my husband who doesn't ever want eggplant, ate this and like it. I had made it for just me since he was gone. He came home and had a snack. Will make it again many times. Placed it over 2 oz(dry) of cooked spaghetti which I spritzed with spray (fake) butter. Amazing, and so few points. Thanks Rhlannon.\"),\n",

You can use any regular cookie dough recipe to make cookie cake, but this one tasted great even when I messed up cooking it. For a cookie cake you preferably have a pan with sides, or put tin foil or a cookie sheet under it to catch messes. I thought about making a tin foil ridge underneath but forgot to try it. Make a slight indentation in the middle, like making a burger, so it is easier to cook through in the middle. Leave an inch or two of space around the outside of the dough to allow for spreading.

Not because I was doing something from experience, but rather I am a new cook who hasn't used much paprika and was a bit hesitant to put the whole 3 tablespoons in, not sure what it would do to the taste since it was already looking and smelling so good. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe there is something missing (more than the paprika I left out). I'm sure adding more salt would help but instead of having to use a lot of salt I'm hoping someone else can figure out a good additional ingredient to push this yummy recipe to a 5. I made it with uncle ben's white rice (my new fav. rice) adding a spoonful of cream cheese to the rice when fluffing at the end. If you've never tried that it's really good! I would have liked to have a good vggie on the side too but couldn't decide on one so I didn't make any! Anyway it tasted so good along side the rice I began to mix it up all together spreading the sauce and fish throughout the rice. Gasp!! Just looked at the recipe again.  I think I figured it out-I left out the OJ!!!  Well, problem solved.  That prob would have given it a 5.  But hey it was still really yummy without.  Good stuff.

Here are my suggestions: First, rewrite the directions, distilling them to just the basics (sorry Cody). I did this in my Mastercook software. I halved the recipe and came out with 2 1/2 lbs. fruit. I chopped the fruit finely but not all the way to a paste - it filled to the brim a quart mason jar. I then poured in as much rum as it would hold (maybe several cups) and turned the jar over every several days for about a month. I baked it in two regular size loaf pans for 2 3/4 hours. I would have preferred the mini loaf pans but forgot to get them. The loaves are now wrapped in cheesecloth which I've soaked several times with more rum, and then wrapped in foil.

I was recently over at my sisters house and while getting Ice cubes for a drink I saw Whole frozen Bananas in her freezer. This is a great idea when you only have one or two bananas left. Throw them in the freezer ( with peel on ) , collecting them until you get around to making the bread. No more waste of bananas in our house. We made a batch yesterday from the frozen ones and it was equally as good as using fresh bananas.'),\n",

Some notes:  The caraway, which is optional, is what really made the dish delicious and a bit different.  I used chicken leg quarters, which I cut, removing whatever fat I could.  For ease, I used my food processor to chop the garlic and parsley, then added the Italian dressing, 1 t. salt and some pepper.  Marinated in a freezer bag overnight.  I cut the carrots into chunks and used lots more - they were the first to go, so I do recommend lots if your family eats them.   I added 3 small onions to my clay pot, and next time, I think I'll also add some cut up cabbage.  Also, the chicken will make its own juice in the pot.  After cooking, I put the chicken in a pan under the broiler for a couple of minutes to further brown/crisp it, removed the veggies to a serving dish, and defatted the chicken liquid to serve alongside.

As for the chicken itself, I loved the use of herbs and did add two more: oregano and sage. A great combination which really gave the chicken a wonderful flavour. I used fresh garlic which (as I usually do!) I doubled and minced and mixed in with the herbs. I used the olive oil and in step nine went with option #1. We SO enjoyed this for dinner several nights ago and what we didn't eat then, we thoroughly enjoyed with baby spinach leaves in the most delicious chicken sandwiches. YUM!

              "  \"Ive tried about all the other popular recipes for healthy french fries on food.com and these are by far the best.  For me it works best on a more thinly cut french fry like that which McDonald's has and spread them out on a cookie sheet so that no fry overlaps another.  I cook them a little longer in the oven than what the recipe states and I leave the skins on for the vitamin/mineral content they supposedly add,  but that's the only thing I had to change.  The salt content in these is perfect for my tastes but for someone that does not like salt as much myself I would recommend lowering the salt used by maybe a quarter or half.  Boiling the fries in the salt water is what really makes this recipe shine.  They cook crisp on the outside and soft in the middle, unlike most the other healthy fry recipes Ive found.  Soooo yummy and as long as you are accounting for the calories, these are just fine for most of you dieters out there.  I never feel full without some carbs and am trying to lose about 10 lbs of belly fat right now so these fit the bill perfectly because they actually fill me up so Im not snacking all night.  Thank you so much for the great recipe MamaJ and Food.com!!  Even if you are not dieting, try these!!  I seriously think they are better than the fries at McDonald's which contain a whopping 19g of fat and 380 calories in a medium size order!!!\"),\n",
